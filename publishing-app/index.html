<!-- index.html in the Root Directory (vs index.html in dist/):

 This is the source HTML file used during development and as the entry point for Vite. 
 It is where you define the structure of your app, include the root <div> for React to mount, 
  and specify the main script (/src/main.tsx) to bootstrap the application.

  Purpose:
  Used by Vite during development (npm run dev).
  Acts as the template for the final production build.
-->

<!-- Why Are Both Needed?

  - Development vs. Production:
  The root index.html is used during development to load unoptimized assets 
  and enable features like hot module replacement (HMR).
  The index.html is used in production to load optimized, minified assets for better performance.

  - Build Process:
  During the build process, Vite takes the root index.html, processes it, 
  and outputs the final index.html in the dist directory along with the bundled assets.

  - Separation of Concerns:
  The root index.html is editable and used for development.
  The index.html is auto-generated and should not be manually edited.
